     *  1. Retrieves the latest user’s [org.librefit.db.entity.Measurement.bodyWeight] at each workout’s completion date.
     *  2. Builds the corresponding [ChartData] items.

     * @param workoutChart The metric to chart (duration, volume, or reps).
     * @param workoutsWithExercises A list of workouts paired with their exercises and sets.
     * @return A list of [ChartData]
