/**
 * Entity representing a set record in the "sets" table.
 *
 * This entity is linked to a [Exercise] entity via a foreign key defined by the [exerciseId] property.
 * The foreign key constraint ensures that when a [Exercise] is deleted, all related sets are also deleted (CASCADE deletion).
 *
 * ### Note
 * - The value of [reps],[weight] and [elapsedTime] are exclusive between each other and it depends
 * by the [Exercise.setMode] value when saving in db. For instance if `setMode = SetMode.WEIGHT`
 * then [reps] and [elapsedTime] are assigned 0.
 * - These properties [reps],[weight] and [elapsedTime] can be edited by the user in
 *  [org.librefit.ui.screens.workout.WorkoutScreen] and [org.librefit.ui.screens.editWorkout.EditWorkoutScreen]
 *
 *
 * @property id The unique identifier for the set. It is auto-generated and serves as the primary key.
 * @property weight The weight used for the set, in kilograms.
 * @property reps The number of repetitions performed in the set.
 * @property elapsedTime The time taken to complete the set, in seconds.
 * @property completed Indicates whether the set has been completed.
 * @property exerciseId This is a foreign key reference to the [Exercise] entity.
