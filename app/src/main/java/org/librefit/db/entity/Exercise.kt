/**
 * Entity representing an exercise record in the "exercises" table.
 *
 * This entity is linked to a [Workout] entity via a foreign key defined by the [workoutId] property.
 * The foreign key constraint ensures that when a [Workout] is deleted, all related exercises are also deleted (CASCADE deletion).
 *
 * @property id The unique identifier for the exercise. It is auto-generated and serves as the primary key.
 * It is used as key identifier in lazy columns too.
 * @property exerciseId It stores [org.librefit.data.ExerciseDC.id] in order to be able to retrieve
 * [org.librefit.data.ExerciseDC] and provide it to [org.librefit.db.relations.ExerciseWithSets]
 * @property notes A user note editable by the user in [org.librefit.ui.screens.workout.WorkoutScreen]
 * and [org.librefit.ui.screens.editWorkout.EditWorkoutScreen]
 * @property setMode The mode of the exercise set editable by the user in
 * [org.librefit.ui.screens.workout.WorkoutScreen] and [org.librefit.ui.screens.editWorkout.EditWorkoutScreen]
 * @property restTime The rest time between sets in seconds editable by the user in
 * [org.librefit.ui.screens.workout.WorkoutScreen] and [org.librefit.ui.screens.editWorkout.EditWorkoutScreen]
 * @property workoutId This is a foreign key reference to the [Workout] entity.
